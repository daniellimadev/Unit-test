# Unit-Testing-with-C#

## Design challenge
For this challenge, you will need to use your knowledge acquired in the Unit Testing with C#.

## Context
You are working on a system, and your managers have reported that there are often problems with the software: bugs, features that were working suddenly no longer work, validation problems, among others. Customers are already starting to doubt the quality of the code.

Having done this, you suggested implementing unit tests: writing tests covering the most critical parts of the system, with positive and negative scenarios, in order to have traceability and control of the code, thus improving the quality of that system.

Managers accepted your idea, and with that, you need to implement unit tests in the system.
